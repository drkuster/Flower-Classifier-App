# Flower-Classifier-App
Flower Classifier uses Apple's latest CoreML tech to identify any flower you throw at it! Now you don't have to guess what flowers you just bought from Home Depot. DISCLAIMER: The intellectual property of this app belongs to the London App Brewery, this is simply my rendition of it through following along with Angela Yu's Complete iOS 13 Bootcamp Course.
