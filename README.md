Flower Classifier uses Apple's latest CoreML tech to identify any flower you throw at it! Now you don't have to guess what flowers you just bought from Home Depot. DISCLAIMER: The intellectual property of this app belongs to the London App Brewery, this is simply my rendition of it through following along with Angela Yu's Complete iOS 13 Bootcamp Course.
